Hi [Client Name],

I'm excited to share that we've completed the AI Concierge development and created a comprehensive user testing framework for you to validate the system with real users.

## 📦 What's Included

I've prepared three documents to help you run structured user testing sessions:

### 1. **USER-TESTING-SCRIPT.md** (Main Guide)
Your complete facilitator handbook with:
- 9 ready-to-use test scenarios across different industries
- Step-by-step instructions for each task
- Questions to ask participants
- Bug reporting templates
- Success criteria and metrics

**Use this**: As your testing playbook during sessions

---

### 2. **TEST-SESSION-CHECKLIST.md** (Quick Reference)
A one-page checklist for each testing session:
- Core flows to validate
- Real-time issue tracking
- Quick satisfaction ratings
- Space for notes and insights

**Use this**: During live sessions to capture feedback quickly

---

### 3. **TESTER-README.md** (For Participants)
A friendly guide for test participants:
- Simple instructions on what to do
- Sample queries they can use
- FAQ section
- Encouragement to provide honest feedback

**Use this**: Send to participants 24 hours before their session

---

## 🎯 Recommended Testing Approach

### Who to Test With (5-10 people)
Aim for a mix of:
- **Industries**: Tech/SaaS, Healthcare, Consumer/Retail, Finance
- **Roles**: Founders, CMOs, Brand Managers, Marketing Directors
- **Tech comfort**: Mix of tech-savvy and less technical users

### Session Structure (45 minutes each)
1. **Introduction** (5 min): Explain the tool, get consent
2. **Core Tasks** (25 min): Follow the test script
3. **Exploration** (10 min): Let them explore freely
4. **Wrap-up** (5 min): Satisfaction survey and feedback

### Timeline Suggestion
- **Week 1**: Recruit participants, schedule sessions
- **Week 2-3**: Conduct 5-10 testing sessions
- **Week 4**: Compile results, prioritize fixes

## 📊 What Success Looks Like

After testing, you should be able to answer:
- ✅ Can users complete the main task (submit query → get results)?
- ✅ Are AI recommendations relevant and helpful?
- ✅ What's working well that we should keep?
- ✅ What needs immediate fixing before launch?
- ✅ Would users recommend this to colleagues?

Target metrics:
- **80%+** task completion rate
- **4/5+** average satisfaction score
- **<10 seconds** response time
- **0** critical bugs
